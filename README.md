## The Command Interpreter
The AirBnB Clone Console is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to manage AirBnB-like objects, such as users, states, cities, places, and more. With this console, you can perform various operations on these objects, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them.
